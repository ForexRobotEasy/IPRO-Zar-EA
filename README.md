# IPRO Zar EA - Forex Trading Robot

IPRO Zar EA is a Forex trading robot developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This robot is designed to trade based on a specific strategy and is suitable for both novice and experienced traders. It is a fully automated trading system that can execute trades on your behalf, saving you time and effort.

This code is a sample implementation of the IPRO Zar EA strategy. It uses moving averages to identify potential pullbacks in the market. When a pullback occurs, the robot enters a trade and sets a stop loss and take profit level. The robot will exit the trade when the pullback ends or when the stop loss or take profit level is reached.

## How it works

1. Include necessary libraries and indicators.

2. Define constants such as recovery factor, maximum lots, stop loss, take profit, and pullback threshold.

3. Initialize global variables including the trade object, previous price, pullback entry price, pullback exit price, and a flag to indicate if the robot is currently in a pullback trade.

4. In the OnTick() function, get the current market price.

5. Check if the current price is a pullback by calling the IsPullback() function.

6. If it is a pullback and the robot is not currently in a pullback trade, enter a buy trade using the trade.Buy() function. Set the pullback entry price and update the inPullback flag.

7. If it is a pullback and the robot is already in a pullback trade, update the pullback exit price.

8. If it is not a pullback and the robot is in a pullback trade, exit the trade using the trade.Sell() function. Reset the inPullback flag.

9. Update the previous price with the current price.

10. The IsPullback() function calculates the moving averages for the specified period and checks if the pullback percentage exceeds the threshold. If it does, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
